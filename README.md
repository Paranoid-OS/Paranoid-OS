## What is Paranoid OS?
Paranoid OS is one of the most secure OS you can run, which can also **seamlessly run apps from multiple OSes in one desktop** using *virtual machines* that make Paranoid OS secure "internally". 

Paranoid OS, inspired by Cory Doctorow's "Paranoid linux" in *Little Brother* and *Homeland* and also QubesOS, is an OS that is secure, both *externally* and *internally*.


## Internal / External security
By *internal security*, I mean the OS is secure from malware that is *inside* the OS.

By *external security*, I mean your files and PC will be safe against physical threats, from *outside* the OS.
